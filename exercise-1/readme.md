# Shiny Review
In the first exercise, you'll be reviewing what you learned from last week and making an shiny app.
The data we'll be working with today is the [Bechdel Test data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bechdel_test) (you can find it in the data folder).

## The goals for this exercise:
- __Target audience__ - Think about who you want to show this shiny to.

- __Data wrangling__ - There's a lot of information in this dataset. Are all the information meaningful for your audience?

- __Data visualization__ - Now you have an insightful dataset, how are you going to present this information? Using plots? Tables? Summary?

- __Data analysis__ - It's important to add analysis along with your graphs, so your users can understand what you're trying to communicate with them.

- __Interactivity__ - Is your shiny user friendly? Can it generate new information based on user input?

- __HTML & CSS__ - You can add HTML & CSS to your shiny app and show your creativity.

- __Publishing Shiny App__ - Finally, you can publish the app and share the link with other people.

### Share with your neighbors after you finish and tell them about your design.
